# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection


This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning models. Since fraudulent transactions are very rare compared to normal transactions, the dataset is highly imbalanced, making fraud detection a challenging problem. The goal is to accurately identify fraud while minimizing false positives.

🔧 Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

* Features

Performed data preprocessing and cleaning

Conducted EDA to study transaction patterns

Handled class imbalance using techniques like:

Undersampling / Oversampling (SMOTE)

Trained and compared multiple machine learning models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree

Random Forest

Evaluated models using:

Accuracy

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall & F1-Score

ROC Curve

* Key Insight

Random Forest performed the best because it reduces overfitting and handles imbalanced data more effectively.

Fraud detection systems require high recall to ensure suspicious cases are not missed.

* Outcome

This project demonstrates how machine learning can be used to:

Detect potentially fraudulent financial transactions

Support banks and payment platforms in reducing fraud losses

Improve overall transaction security
